This script has a clear and simple workflow. It prompts you to select a folder that contains all your JSON data. Then it will find the files in that folder, open them, extract the key QA paramters and their corresponding measurement dates. It will then present you with a simple menu in the command line, asking which parameter you want to see trended. Finally, it will generate a plot of the parameter that was chosen for the values over time.
